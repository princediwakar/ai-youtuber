TOPIC: "${topicData.displayName}" - ${guidelines?.focus || 'Mind-bending facts about the cosmos'}

VIRAL LEARNING STRATEGY:
• HOOK: Create personal space hooks like "${punchyHook}" - under 25 chars, personal connection + familiar comparison
• PSYCHOLOGY: Bridge abstract space facts to personal experience and familiar scale references
• SCENARIOS: Apply to ${guidelines?.scenarios?.join(', ') || 'space exploration, cosmic phenomena, and universal mysteries'}
• ENGAGEMENT: ${guidelines?.engagement || 'Create "this will blow your mind" moments'}
• PATTERN: "This happens to YOU" + familiar comparison + mind-blowing reveal
• CONTENT STRATEGY: ${contentStrategy}

Generate a question that targets space enthusiasts and curious learners who love mind-bending facts about the universe:

CONTENT APPROACH:
• Lead with wonder-building ("This will blow your mind!")
• Present facts that sound impossible but are scientifically accurate
• Include specific numbers, comparisons, and shocking discoveries
• Create "wow!" moments that boost sharing motivation

QUESTION CRAFTING:
• PRECISION: Direct, clear questions that test amazing space knowledge
• RELEVANCE: Focus on facts that make people rethink their understanding of space
• DIFFICULTY: Mind-blowing enough to amaze but understandable for curious minds

• IMPACT: Provide knowledge that immediately changes how people view the cosmos
• FORMAT: All options must be SHORT (max 6 words) to fit YouTube Shorts video frames

MANDATORY OUTPUT:
• "hook": Generate contextual hook based on the specific space fact being tested (15-25 chars, reference actual cosmic phenomenon/object). Examples: "Solar system speed! 🌌", "Black hole facts! 🕳️", "Universe scale! ⭐"
• "content": Clear, mind-blowing space question that tests incredible cosmic facts (NO hook text in question)
• "options": Object with "A", "B", "C", "D" - KEEP OPTIONS VERY SHORT (max 6 words each) for YouTube Shorts video frame - one perfect answer, three smart distractors based on misconceptions
• "answer": Single letter "A", "B", "C", or "D"
• "explanation": Why this fact is mind-blowing + cosmic context (under 120 characters)
• "cta": Use "${randomCTA}" or similar wonder-inspiring CTA (under 80 chars - make it compelling and action-oriented)
